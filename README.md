# Bodyfat-Percentage
The purpose of our analysis was to predict body fat percentages in young male adults. By using simple body measurements, people can accurately predict their bodyfat percentage without the need for expensive tests. Multiple linear regression was utilized in R to come up with a "rule of thumb" for young men to predict their bodyfat.
